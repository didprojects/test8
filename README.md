Borrower Summary function lists the borrower information including boorowerid, borrower full name, and the number of loans each borrower has had. The template staff_list_borrower_summary.html passes borrower data to route /list-borrower-summary.

## Design Decisions

The public Search Book funciton and Staff page share header navigation bar.

Searching result and list all books wil show the book details, but the book descriptions are too long, so the "title" attribute has been used to make it shorter, and user can see the whole detail information by hovering mouse on the description area.

This applicaiton used POST method on many page displays, such as search book, search borrower, using POST method to get the user input.
POST method is also used on the issue book, return book, add borrower and update borrower pages to get user input and update the database.

The Update Borrower and Add Borrower function make the length validation by using "maxlength" attribute to make sure that the database can be updated correctly.

The Issue Book and Return Book, both use "datalist" to increase search efficiency, user can not only choose bookcopy and borrower but also can enter text or numbers to search. 

The Search Book and Search Borrower page provide "List All" function to display all the bookcopies or borrowers.

The public Search Book result displays a descriptive list for book information, but the staff Search Book result displays a detailed table for staff to check more information.

## Discussion

Every branch's database must be needed if this application was to support multiple library branches. 

The books and bookcopies table need to add a column to indicate that which library branch this bookcopy is availible. Loans table needs to add a column to indicate which library branch this book has been returned to.( assuming that readers can return book to any branch) 

The current tables' need to change, in order to distinguish which branch table to use in the application. The borrower table can be shared for all the branches, so the result of Update Borrower and Add Borrower would share within branches too.

The web needs to add a branch access for public book search, because readers may want to see the availibility of books in the nearest branch. If user just uses the public search, the search result will list the branches each bookcopy is availible in.

Issue and Return Book would let the staff choose which branch they would like to issue from or return to. 

Staff page needs to add branch access for staff to check each branch's database information. For example, staff can search book from different branches, list all books of each branch, list loans summary and borrower summary in each branch.
